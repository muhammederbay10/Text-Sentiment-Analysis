# Text Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This project provides a complete workflow for fine-tuning a BERT model to classify text sentiment. The model is trained on the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset to distinguish between positive and negative reviews. A user-friendly web interface is included, built with Streamlit, to allow for easy testing and inference.
